Please create a list of topics for a course on *Power BI*, where each topic is a numbered lesson and its subdivisions are indicated by decimal numbers. Topics must follow the format 'Class X', 'Class X.Y', where X is the main class number and Y is the subdivision number. Here is the initial list:

-------------------------------------------------- -----
tips:
Structure classes and subdivisions (one below the other).
Divide into sections.
Include initial topics to identify the desired numbering pattern, e.g.:

Class Section 1
Lesson 1, Lesson 1.2
Class Section 2:
Class 2, Class 2.1
and so on.

Note: it is not necessary to put class section 1, class section 2 at the beginning.
